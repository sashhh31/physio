      Back pain affects millions of people worldwide and can stem from poor posture, injuries, or underlying conditions.
      
      Here are some ways to manage it:
      1. Maintain a healthy posture when sitting and standing.
      2. Incorporate regular stretching into your daily routine.
      3. Avoid lifting heavy objects improperly — bend your knees, not your back.
      4. Strengthen your core muscles through exercise.
      5. Seek professional help if the pain persists for more than a week.
      
      Physiotherapy plays a crucial role in treating back pain, with targeted exercises and manual therapy helping restore mobility and reduce discomfort.

      Our bones naturally lose density with age, but lifestyle choices can slow this process.
      
      Tips for bone health:
      1. Eat a calcium-rich diet — dairy, leafy greens, fortified products.
      2. Get enough vitamin D from sunlight or supplements.
      3. Engage in weight-bearing exercises like walking, running, and resistance training.
      4. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake.
      
      Regular bone density tests after age 50 can help detect early signs of osteoporosis. Prevention is easier than treatment, so start young.

    title: "Recovering from Injuries: The Right Way",
    excerpt:
      "Injury recovery takes patience and proper care — rushing the process can lead to setbacks...",

      Whether it's a sprain, fracture, or muscle strain, the recovery process involves several stages.
      
      The RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) is key in the early days.
      After the initial inflammation subsides, physiotherapy can restore range of motion, rebuild strength, and prevent reinjury.
      
      Avoid returning to sports or intense activity too soon. Gradual progression, guided by a healthcare professional, ensures long-term recovery.

      Sports injuries range from mild sprains to severe fractures. Prevention is as important as treatment.
      
      Steps to reduce risk:
      1. Warm up and stretch before activity.
      2. Use proper equipment and protective gear.
      3. Stay hydrated and maintain muscle flexibility.
      4. Listen to your body — stop if you feel pain.
      
      If injured, consult a physiotherapist early. Targeted exercises and therapy can speed recovery and prevent chronic issues.
